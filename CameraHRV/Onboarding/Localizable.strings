HRV can be affected by personal data from gender to exercise pattern, and also from every factor in the environment such as air quality. \n\n HRV is also distinct for each person so comparing with others would not provide accurate information, only to compare with some people who have similar demographics would be beneficial. Paying attention to HRV gives a great picture of daily life and overall health. \n\n It's applied in investigations of various industries and function areas from sleep analysis to serious cardiac problems such as heart failure. Study aims to get more insight about possible improvements of HRV usage in our daily life.";
